# Sample Test File

This is a sample file created for testing the PR workflow in the Monte Carlo repository.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate creating a branch
- Adding a file to the branch
- Creating a PR from the branch to main

## Monte Carlo Simulation Notes
Monte Carlo simulations are computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.

In the insurance context, these simulations can be used for:
- Risk assessment
- Premium calculation
- Portfolio optimization
- Reserve estimation
